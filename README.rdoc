Demo Sinatra app that shows integration with the LinkedIn API. Relies on the
{linkedin gem}[https://rubygems.org/gems/linkedin]. Allows you to search
through your LinkedIn connections looking for connections that have skills
related to your search term. A working example can be found at
http://skillmatch.herokuapp.com

Since this is just a demo, the search algorithm is *very* naive; it uses the
Jaro Winkler method provided by the {amatch gem}[https://rubygems.org/gems/amatch].

== Contributing

=== Issues / Roadmap
* Search algorithm is naive.

Use GitHub issues[http://github.com/bnadlerjr/skillmatch/issues] for reporting bug and feature requests.

=== Patches / Pull Requests
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I donâ€™t break it in a future version
  unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history (if you want to have
  your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can
  ignore when I pull).
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
